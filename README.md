# card-revealing-CLI
This project is the product of an Java class assignment in university (due to that, the program is in German). The program draws and reveals cards from a card stack until one of the cards has the rank jack, queen or king. The user can decide how many of these drawing sequences will be executed by the program. 

In order to execute the program, you have to download the code and save the files in a local folder. Then set this local folder as your working directory and type "java Main" in your Shell.
